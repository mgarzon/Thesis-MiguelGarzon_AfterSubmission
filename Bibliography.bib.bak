  Abstract                 = {UML modelling tools provide poor support for composite state machine code generation. Generated code is typically complex and large, especially for composite state machines. Existing approaches either do not handle this case at all or handle it by flattening the composite state machine into a simple one with a combi- natorial explosion of states, and excessive generated code. This paper presents a new approach that trans- forms a composite state machine into an equivalent set of simple state machines before code generation. This avoids the combinatorial explosion and leads to more concise and scalable generated code. We imple- ment our approach in Umple. We report on a case study, comparing our approach to others in terms of code size and scalability.}

This paper describes in detail that the realization of improvement for Rete algorithm applied in rule engine systems such as Telecom Billing System in two ways-Alpha-Node-Hashing which specifies how to find Alpha Nodes in the Alpha Memory by hashing, and Beta-Node-Indexing which mainly describes in creating index for Beta Nodes in the Beta Memory to speed searching. Then a series of experiments were made to verify the results. The results show that these two methods significantly improve system performance, and effectively make up for deficiencies in performance bottleneck of processing efficiency in telecom billing system.},

  Abstract                 = {Many CASE tools support reverse engineering and UML. However, it can be observed that, usually, only a subset of the UML notation is supported, namely those parts with a more or less direct code representation. Although a lot of research has been done in this field, the more advanced features of UML notations are not commonly supported in reverse engineering. In this paper, we show approaches to discover patterns in program code that can be represented by means of the advanced notational features of UML class diagrams. We obtain the necessary information by reverse-engineering Java programs with different methods. These have been implemented in a prototype implementation},

  Abstract                 = {Umple adds UML abstractions to base programming languages such as Java, PHP and Ruby. The resulting program can be seen as both model and code at the same time. Umplification is the process of converting a base language program to Umple by a series of refactorings. The result is a program semantically equivalent to the original, but which can be rendered and edited as UML diagrams by a modeling tool or manipulated as a textual program for those who prefer. In this paper we discuss the principles of Umple, the process of umplification, and two examples including umplification of the Umple compiler itself.},

Umple allows UML to be viewed both textually and graphically, with updates to one view reflected in the other. It allows UML concepts to be added to programming languages, plus web-based code generation from UML to those languages. We have used Umple in student laboratories and assignments for two years, and also live in the classroom. In a survey, students showed enthusiasm about Umple, and indicated they believe it helps them understand UML better. Improvements in their grades also support our approach.},
